This: I'm Juan and I'm updating this markdown file here.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")
```

we are asking: is there a significant difference in recommended gun control action for male ande female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)? 1


Hey Juan, how is it going? :) 


Juan: Data wrangling and counts

chi sqaure: are proportions across groups so different that there is a significant difference

```{r}
get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns) 
```
